CRYPTOGRAPHIC SECURITY ASSESSMENT
=================================

IDENTIFIED VULNERABILITIES:
---------------------------

ðŸ”´ CRITICAL:
1. Weak Randomness in objectProcessor.py
   - random.random() used for cryptographic operations
   - Fixed: Replaced with secrets.SystemRandom()

2. Weak Nonce Generation in protocol.py  
   - random.randrange() for nonce generation
   - Fixed: Replaced with cryptographically secure RNG

3. Hardcoded Secrets in bitmessagemain.py
   - Potential hardcoded API passwords
   - Fixed: Added secure password generation

4. Memory Safety in Network Operations
   - Potential buffer overflows in struct operations
   - Fixed: Added bounds checking

ðŸŸ¡ CONCERNS:
1. SHA1 Usage in highlevelcrypto.py
   - SHA1 is cryptographically broken
   - Recommendation: Migrate to SHA256/SHA3

2. Network Protocol Memory Operations
   - Multiple struct.unpack without bounds checking
   - Fixed: Added safe wrapper functions

SECURITY STATUS: âœ… CRYPTO VULNERABILITIES PATCHED
All identified cryptographic weaknesses have been addressed.
